# Prep Points for Apptio
Pointers from Harsha:
1. OOPS concepts are very crucial
2. DS, should know all the DS insertion traversal and sorting algo concepts. Along with their time and space complexity
3. CV projects you should have good grip on
4. 


Must to do list:
1. All DSA practice: Traversal, insertion deletion. Time and space complexity 2d array
2. All sorting algos with written code implementation
3. All oops theory and written, do MCQs also
4. All other basic algorithms

Points not to miss, should be done tuesday night:
1. final keyword - done
2. sorting algos explanation and complexities - done
3. Project recap of all the projects 
4. comparator - done
5. bst


Morning: 
    All tree methods written algo
    time complexity revision
    heap revision
    Linkedlist methods
    Merge and Quick sort
    OOPS reading


Revision:
Linkedlist
Trees
OOPS

Done:

OOPS theory
Trees
LinkedList Basics - reverse and recursive approach
