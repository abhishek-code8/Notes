# Java Basics and OOPS
Java is a statically typed language, that is, the type of the variable cannot be changed once the application is complied. The checking is done by the compiler is called Static type checking. Javascript is a dynamically typed language as the type of variable can be changed or the variable can store different type of data.


Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform-independent.

---
Java is machine independent: It means one code can run anywhere on any machine. The java provides java based platform. It has two components 
1. Runtime Environment
2. API(Application Development Interface)
The java code is compiled by the compiler into bytecode and bytecode is platform independent

In java the size of the variables is not fixed unlike C. So this makes it architecturally netural


Java Supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management(Garbage collection)

### Terms:
1. Class Loader in java is a part of JRE. It is responsible to dynamically load a class into JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
2. Java gives automatic grabage collection in JVM that collects all the unsed objects by the application

Important Terms:
1. JRE: Java runtime Enverionment
2. JVM: Java Virtual Machine : It is a kind of a virtual machine as it does not exist in real. It provides the runtime for the execution of the bytecode




## Classes and Objects
Everything in Java us an object. Classes are a logical entity. Objects are an instance of a class

### OOPS - Object oriented programming
1. Class
2. Obejcts
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation



## STD Input and Output
- System.out.println(): take the cursor to the next line
- System.out.print(): Keeps the cursor at the end of the same line
- System.out.println() Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class.
